## 🔬 Lung Cancer Risk Prediction using Machine Learning
🌟 Advanced Machine Learning App with Streamlit Interface
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the risk level of lung cancer based on clinical and lifestyle-related symptoms. It is integrated with an interactive Streamlit-based web interface and includes doctor consultation support via Google search.

## 📈 Project Highlights
✅ ML Model trained using a real-world lung cancer dataset.

✅ Balanced classification using SMOTE to mitigate bias.

✅ Random Forest Classifier for robust predictions.

✅ Streamlit UI with high-contrast, responsive design.

✅ Google search integration to consult nearby doctors.

✅ Custom background, symptom sliders, and risk indicators.

## 🧪 Model Training Details
